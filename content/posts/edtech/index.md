Having worked in an EdTech startup, I realized how impactful digital education technologies are becoming right now. You will also discover how is to work in a high-tech small startup.

# Introduction

For the first time, I travelled to Asia, that happened the last summer. The most populated continent in the world with near 60% of the total. Asia has experimented an astronomical growth in different aspects. Literacy and, industrial and economic growth are probably the most remarkable ones since they impact directly in the lives of their people. Globalization in the form of tourism and occidental-like business models originated in Europe and America, have been the main catalysts for such growth.

Particularly, I visited Java, among other spots in Indonesia. This island is the most populated in the world with +141 million people; and the capital of the country, Jakarta, is allocated in here.

{{< figure align="center" width="50%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Indonesia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/1920px-Indonesia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png" title="Indonesia's location">}}

{{< figure align="center" width="50%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Java_Locator.svg/2880px-Java_Locator.svg.png" title="Java's location">}}

In the capital, I could witness how high-density populations affects its citizens. One effect I observed is a significant social gap. Few people seemed extremely rich compared to the vast majority, who had to work endless hours per day for a miserable income.

Other cities in Java looked shockingly poor and overpopulated such as Yogyakarta. It was impactful to see there was no waste management at all, the streets were landfills themselves, even the streets contiguous to the 5-star hotel I was hosted in with my friends. Sadly, people looked like they live on the streets. Visiting rural areas was like traveling to the past, a truly awakening experience.

Many of the problems I witnessed were possible to fix with a proper organization, management and education. It was sad to see much pain and scarcity could be addressed, but they weren't because of lack of knowledge and coordination. English was not understood by many, so the way to communicating was kind of by intuition and signs. I didn't even bother to try Spanish. I guess in the Philippines I would have some chance, but totally not here.

# The importance of English

Since local currency is weak, people working under its domain were earning way unfairly lower compared to the ones who dedicated their jobs to tourism or overseas businesses.

By just knowing English, globalized locals could get ahead with deals with foreigners who come from stronger economies. Not only that, but also can get know-how and ideas to apply for possible business models. Literally a cultural enrichment exchange.

English is currently the main language for businesses and the Internet. Since digitalization growing influence, it is important to get educated in it, not only to reach more audience, customers and content but also to avoid fragmentation and duplication of the information of the public humankind knowledge, which is the Internet.

# Digitalization and the EdTech

When I was researching and planning my trip there, I realized most websites look pretty obsolete. Large businesses running on old shitty versions of _Blogger_, with content only in the local language and having WhatsApp contacts as a main contact channel was kind of impressive to me. In the western world, we are used to another ways to do business.

Certainly, there are websites available in English for touristic purposes, but these business are the typical ones that charge from 5 to 10 times more compared to the local ones. So to optimize our budget, I decided it is clever to seek for local business who do the same. But for that, I had to use the translator for many of these websites. And when contacted them to arrange activities, they somehow managed to find someone to answer in poor English.

Internet fragmentation by language is a problem, because without providing information in major languages, you discard a valuable portion of potential customers.

Summing up, knowing English opens you lots of doors of possibilities.

What if the most optimal way to provide the same opportunities within a population that struggles of a high degree of inequality is just providing easily accessible knowledge? And what is the best way to achieve that?

>Scalable software for education and civil organization

But for that there is a requirement, connection to the Internet, which fortunately most people in the second decade of this century already have access, even in places like Java.

As software developer in an EdTech startup, I could see major improvements in environments where education is likely not enough and unequal. Education quality and opportunities in an international school in Jakarta for rich people, is for sure not the same as in a rural village, or other cities in a hyper-massified island.

# Jolly Phonics

Fortunately, English is one of the easiest languages to learn given the simplicity that offers. However, it is taught incorrectly in many places around the globe since there is a lack of focus on phonetics, which is actually a key piece in this language.

>Phonetics focus on how humans produce and perceive sounds

There is a popular editorial company in England, [_Jolly Learning_](https://www.jollylearning.co.uk) that provides education for children English by [_Jolly Phonics_](https://www.jollylearning.co.uk/jolly-phonics/) program which focus on synthetic phonics.

They have grown influence in all over the world such that they have contracts with governments in Africa among others. Therefore, their English teaching methods are taught by teachers worldwide known as _Official Jolly Trainers_.

## Methodology

The _Jolly Phonics_ approach to teaching reading and writing begins with introducing the 42 letter sounds, which include both alphabet sounds and digraphs like /sh/, /th/, /ai/, and /ue/. Step 1 of the program focuses on developing the five key skills of _Jolly Phonics_: learning letter sounds, letter formation, blending, segmenting, spelling patterns, alternative spelling of vowels, long and short vowels, and tricky words.

Through the use of various multisensory techniques, children learn how to form and write letters, as well as blend sounds together to read and write new words. In addition, they are taught to identify and break down the sounds in words through segmenting. The program also emphasizes the concept of tricky words, where children learn that certain words have irregular spellings. With these skills, children are equipped with the foundational tools to become confident readers and writers.

>Despite they are focused on children education, their methodology is also applicable for all ages

## A digital platform as the ultimate scalability

Traditionally, the editorial company has been working with books, booklets, workbooks, template sheets and material assets. The business model has been working nicely so far, however it lacks of proper scalability since it is limited by:
- material resources
- suppliers
- teachers

The solution? The digitalization of the business model. This is a pattern shown by major educational companies in the western world. Therefore, it is fundamental to adapt to market trends, so the business survives new times to come. For that, [_Jolly Technologies_](https://jollytechnologies.co.uk/), a subsidiary of _Jolly Phonics_, works to create digital products which encapsulates what these material assets contain in a highly scalable and interactive way.

The product I worked with is [_Jolly Classroom_](https://www.jollyclassroom.com/), a multiplatform app initially developed for web (chrome-based app). Although, since it is developed in a multiplatform framework, _Flutter_, it is supposed to be relatively easy to create adaptations for other operative systems such as _WindowsOS, MacOS, LinuxOS, iPad, iOS, Android, ..._

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cuyRaVJy-HA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p/>

In comparison with the traditional teaching methods, it presents the following advantages:
- There is no need for material assets, just a compatible device with Internet connection
- Lessons are more interactive: there are animations and sounds that help students learning
- Lessons can be taught remotely: in remote places, there might be lack of teachers

Some will think this is a blatant threat to the existence of teachers. This is false since it just evolves the way to work, especially children will always need human interaction as a guide during their learning path. In addition, this is an unavoidable trend since this presents the most optimal way to follow for the business model. Therefore, it is better idea to adapt to new trends rather than to fight against them.

# A day as a software engineer

The small team of _Jolly Technologies_ startup when I was working with them was composed by 3 software engineers, including me, and a [UX designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience). There were also _Jolly Learning_ staff who leads the conceptual direction of the app.

A typical day is a stand-up meeting via _Slack_ video call 30 mins after the start of the workday, in which every team member exposes:
- what has been up to
- issues that stuck or slow down progress
- what is going to do for the day

The workflow starts with _Jolly Learning_ requesting new features. Then there is a meeting with them discussing these and if it is possible technically to implement them. For the agreed new characteristics, the UX designer draws them in collaborative platforms such as *Figma* where it is accessible for us, the developers. We discuss in case of any possible conflict with the UX designer to amend the designs. After this step, we start coding.

The way to contribute to the software is done by [_Git_](https://git-scm.com/) version control with an online private repository in _GitHub_.

The main branches of work are:
- `master`: where the app is in production
- `staging`: where the app is being tested and developed

And no, there was no `development` branch. Contrarily to the business standards, in my opinion it was OK to not have it since that is more suitable for larger organizations.

So once a member create the contribution, it creates a branch from `staging` with the name of the feature and then submits it as a _Pull Request_ to the common repository. That _PR_ is then reviewed by a peer and if approved, then is merged to `staging`. If a team member is stuck, that's OK, it was assisted by pairing either in person or remotely by a video call sharing screen or sharing session within the *IDE*.

These new contributions then are tested by the UX designer, and if approved, then later by _Jolly Learning_ staff, who we had meetings with on a weekly basis. If they find something weird, then we come back to the code and fix the issues they found.

The first weeks of having joined the team, consisted on me testing, fixing bugs and creating documentation on the *GitHub Wiki*. Later on and fortunately, I felt like another gear within the engine.

## Tech stack

>The following information needs to be generic in order to protect the business know-how and intel

{{< figure align="center" src="images/jolly_classroom_tech_stack.png" title="Tech stack overview" >}}

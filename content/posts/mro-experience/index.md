Often only pilots, aeronautical designers, aircraft traffic controllers and crew staff are known to the public. However, there are other unsung heroes known as aviation MRO engineers that keep global economy working and save countless lives per year. In this post, I am going to show cool information about this job regarding my experience as one of them.

# Introduction

MRO stands for Maintenance, Repairment and Overhaul. The working environment of this job tends to be allocated in factories, specialized workshops and hangars. Most of the time, in contact with aircraft and/or their components.

In order to perform the job, MRO engineers have a stretch communication with:
- maintenance operators
- production control
- MRO program managers

but also with other departments:
- chemical procedures department
- design department
- production department

In addition, they are in continuous communication with suppliers, customers and subcontracted companies.

# Aircraft portfolio

In the company I worked for, I had the opportunity to get involved in MRO tasks applied to equipment from both civil and military aircraft. Most of these were from Europe, but also from North America.

# Target Units of MRO engineering

Particularly, the type of components I had to work with were mainly:
- Landing gears and components
- Hydraulic systems
- Pneumatic systems
- Ramp hydraulic actuation systems
- Electromechanical actuation

These are the subsystems inside an aircraft which enables the actuation of the different mechanisms. Some applications of such mechanisms are:
- flaps actuation
- landing gear
  - structure
  - extension and retraction
  - steering and control
- doors and ramps actuation

# Protocol

The general protocol as for MRO activities are based in the following flow diagram:

<p></p>

{{< figure align="center" src="images/esquema-mro.png" title="Protocol diagram" >}}

All the documentation and operations can be registered via SAP [^1]. This is a software for the management of business processes which enables data processing and information across internal (department) and external organizations. Every piece is registered with its correspondent P/N, S/N (if applicable) and location within the facilities. 

# MRO Activities

They consist mainly in _repairment_, _overhaul_ and _retrofit_:

## 1. Repairment

Self-explanatory.

## 2. Overhaul

Aircraft manufacturing is a complex process in which many stakeholders, certifications and processes are involved. That is why they are expensive assets that are not simply just scrapped away because of the reason they become too old. That would be a waste of resources and an inefficient way to renew assets.

> How then is possible to by-pass obsolescence?

The answer relies on an existing circular economy. Which is based on the re-process of the product in order to renew it so that it complies the required specifications.

<p></p>

{{< figure align="center" src="images/linear-circular-economy.png" title="Linear vs Circular economy" >}}

In the aeronautics, this is known as Overhaul.

Let's imagine the following situation. A cargo airplane has reached 1000 flights on its lifecycle. The design specifications of the corresponding landing gears indicate that these components are safe to operate 1000 cycles. This means that their lifecycle is over. Then, to comply the safety certifications, such components are dispatched to workplaces certified to operate overhaul works in order to "restart" their lifecycle counter. By the way, this situation was a common one given during my experience.

Once the landing gears (both main left and right, and the auxiliary one) arrive to the facility, all the operations are based on the _Protocol diagram_ (shown before).

Despite the case it is _Not Fault Found_ after the initial _Product Acceptance Test_ (the component works correctly), there is always a disassembly operation in order to perform:
1. As it is compulsory by certifications, replaceable parts like bolts, nuts, bushings, bearings and o-rings are to be replaced by new ones
2. Complete removal of sealing and painting
3. Every critical part, like pistons and cylinders, is inspected rigorously in order to detect possible microscopic cracks or pores
4. Sealing everything again
5. Painting everything again

>Painting and Sealing are polymer-based materials which degenerates over time and also accumulate particles that can be degrading for the material, that is the reason they are always totally reprocessed

## 3. Retrofit

In the aeronautics, this is the process of replacing components which have been declared obsolete or outdated by the manufacturer design engineers. This is nothing to do with the lifecycle duration of a component but the design of an updated version which solves a problem (a bug) of a past version.

Retrofit operations are way more common for aircraft in _FAL_ [^2]. The early stages of the lifecycle of an aircraft can present high volatility in terms of product iteration. That is because innovation is risky and must be tested properly as a fatal mistake can threaten human life.

Before the launch of the aircraft model to the market, the production goes throughout alpha and beta phases in which the components are tested during flights.

<p></p>

{{< figure align="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/A321_final_assembly_%289351765668%29.jpg/1280px-A321_final_assembly_%289351765668%29.jpg" title="A321 on Final Assembly Line" >}}

Let's imagine the following situation. An aircraft is on the _FAL_ and is being tested by flight engineers. The tests showed an anomaly in the nose landing gear during the landing as presented a high level of vibrations in the steering system. Then, the engineering team is assigned an investigation in order to spot the root cause of the problem. After reverse engineering, it is concluded that a design specification of the steering selective valve is incorrectly designed.

Now the design department of the manufacturer is communicated with the issue, and then a new iteration in the lifecycle of that product is initiated. After all the procedures, a new configuration of the steering selective valve is released and all the previous versions are declared obsolete a retired from the market. This new configuration is just a simple change: drilling a hole slightly bigger.

The company operating the previously mentioned aircraft on the _FAL_, dispatches the nose landing gear to a certified facility in order to retrofit that obsolete component by the updated version which is re-engineered to prevent such vibration anomalies to repeat in the future.

Now the certified company dissembles the unit, fetches the component to retrofit and performs the corresponding processes to apply the updating operations. In this case, drilling a bigger hole. Everything is done following the protocols (like shown in the previous diagram).

# Common Faults

The most common issues found by MRO personnel are:

- Corrosion

- Strikes

- Pores

- Material wear

- Microscopic cracks

- Fatal breaks
 
- Electronic failures

# Common Repairments

The repairment procedures are methodical and must follow the guidelines provided by the manufacturer instructions as _CMM_ [^3] or _DM_ [^4].

>In the case of units dispatched from FAL, there is no applicable CMM or DM. Instead, technical drawings are used as a guideline for repairment procedures.

The most common procedures MRO production engineers apply are regarding my experience:

- Painting
  - regeneration of paint damaged layers
- Sealing
  - regeneration of damaged sealant
- Machining
  - lathing
  - milling
  - grinding
  - drilling
- Manual surface reworks
  - minimal defects found in the surface
- Thermal treatment
  - molecular restructuring of steel by exposure of high temperatures
- Surface protection regeneration
  - [High velocity oxygen fuel spraying (HVOF)](https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-a-high-velocity-oxygen-fuel-coating)
    - increases erosion and wear resistance
    - corrosion protection

    - adds strength
    - reduce the stress profile

# Market context

As for the publication date of this post, MRO activities are one of the most profitable business in the aeronautical industry. One of the reasons are that costs are relatively low compared to production or R&D. 

Geopolitical conditions like Covid19, lack of supply of electronic components from China, Brexit and other threats decrease investments in R&D and new aircraft programs. In contrast, the MRO activities are more resilient since there will be always a need of maintaining what is already deployed.

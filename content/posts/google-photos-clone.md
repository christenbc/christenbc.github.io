Many people use Google Photos or Apple Photos as a way of backing-up and sharing pictures and videos that are stored chronologically and can be arranged in albums.
As a freelance software developer, I built an app for iOS and Android which had to have a similar technology.

# Situation

A customer wanted me to build an app which stores online to the cloud screenshots of any mobile devices (iOS or Android) in a seamless way.

Once that is accomplished, these screenshots can be managed so that they can be tagged and metadata (title, description, link, location) can be added and indexed, so they can be searched via a text field.

# Task

There were many tasks involved in this project. But the most relevant ones were related to:

- md5 to set ids
- upload in batches to the database
- simultaneous upload to the cloud bucket

# Action


# Results

That app is in production with paid plans for pro membership.

# Citizen's role in society

When humans were organized in squads of nomadic tribalism in the prehistoric ages, every single individual contributed with some tasks and skills which were somehow useful for the survival of the group. This was a requirement since scarcity of resources and food was common as there was no systematical accumulation on reservoirs, they were similar to the current *Paycheck to Paycheck* people of nowadays but on a different context.

Thousands of years later, humans changed their lifestyle to sedentarism, which enabled them the luxury of getting some of them relaxed, as there was an increase in cooperative tasks and thus an increase in tasks delegation. Also, enabling the capability of accumulating resources and food were key on this process. Therefore, there was not required a constant contribution of every member of the community (formerly composed in "squads") through the time.

Nowadays, things have not changed too much regarding that aspect but there some exceptions. Providing products and services of every member in a community is something expected in a healthy Estate. However, modern economies and political democratic systems now seek for two additional assets: 
- tax returns
- votes

The current system seems to increase the weights of these both assets compared to product and services generation.

In order to maximize both, there way to maximize their returns is to: 
- regulate more and more, and create more taxable events
- manipulate information and increase people dependency on the Estate

Increase taxes and their control.

Create a biased society even if it is not ethical.

# Estate's power

It is proven through history that the more power a subject obtains, the more difficult is to transfer it.

Humans brain works based in beliefs. They are necessary in order to automate in the subconscious many mental tasks that if we had to process consciously, we would not be capable of surviving. For example, some "simple" task for a person is to walk. We take it for granted because we delegated such know-how to the subconscious. In order to walk, we need to belief that we will not fail on the next step.

Beliefs are the core of our lives.

## Why artists are only venered when already passed away?

It is well common that Bitcoin attracts smart money because it is a:
- programmatically deflationary asset
- open source: transparent for auditories
- decentralized: not depending on single point failures
- cybernetically robust

What it's not often mentioned but it is a key reason smart money trust this asset is that it is absolutely neutral. The creator/s, Satoshi Nakamoto, is unknown and the belonging bitcoin addresses have not been active for a very long period of time. Which means:
- a) he lost the private keys (but he stopped his activity on forum)
- b) he has left society
- c) he is dead or disabled
- d) he is waiting (unlikely)

Therefore, there is currently "nobody" behind Bitcoin leadership. In other words, bitcoin is now an idea, not someone's else product or service. This is key. Human psychology is based on beliefs and hope, we trust and respect more ideological movements and dead artists, than current ideals or alive artists.

Dead people are mass psychologically more respected than alive people (art, science, ...)

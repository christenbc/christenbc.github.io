Entrepreneurship is one of the riskiest activities anyone can endeavor and probabilities are waiting for you to fail.
But, data is your best friend and exploiting human psychology is the most powerful weapon for any business to success. However, these evidences are learned sometimes too late and the hard way.

>Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities, regarding Wikipedia.

In the world of financial investors it is like avoiding putting all the eggs in the same basket, that is investing too large portions of the capital in certain assets. What successful financial investors do is to diversify into different assets so that they minimize the probabilities of poor or even negative <abbr title="Return of Interest">ROI</abbr> induced by a bad investment.

Similarly, financial traders avoid investing large portions of their capital in single financial operations. How do they minimize risks? Simply, they allocate small portions of their capital for such operations. However, if they want to focus on a single or few assets for operating, they allocate large amounts of their capital, but they limit their risks by setting a maximum admissible loss, in case the worst happens, with a limit called Stop Loss.

I found there is a similarity with entrepreneurship. Once someone intends to create a business model and get to operate it, should set a red line that indicates not going beyond.

Did you know about the _boiling frog_ metaphor? It talks about that if a frog is put right into boiling water, it will jump out, however if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not jump out and will be cooked to death. This story warns out the consequences of showing unwillingness or inability to be aware or react to threats that arise gradually rather than quickly.

One of the major threats of an entrepreneur is to waste unaffordable amounts of energy, time and even money in a business idea that simply just does not work properly.

It is part of the pop culture that a successful entrepreneur is one that invests an incredible amount of effort, time and money and gets to work its business while getting filthy rich. What you are not being told is the vast proportion of them that wasted years of their life miserably in an idea that simply does not fit the market requirements.

A product market fit should feel natural, not forced. Just like when dating someone, if a relationship is forced, it will likely fail. For that to work, the process should be like the stream being formed by the water flowing from a spring.

In my case, since my team bootstrapped everything, we controlled well our money and other's money as well. However, I agreed with my team that we should set a clear deadline by which if we do not get evidences of the existence of significant and consistent early adopters, we should stop working. You might say, that is possible to pivot and change strategy. Sure, that's ok. However, every pivotal strategy, might involve extra time that takes too long to be affordable.


## To Pivot or Not to Pivot

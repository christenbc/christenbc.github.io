The plan for this website is to post experiences, projects and cool stuff that are somehow useful or interesting for you.
<!--more-->

I have decided to share with the world some cool projects I have been working on related to engineering & business, as well as
interesting ideas, and concepts I have been learning so far.

The main topics will be related to technical stuff, such as:
- software engineering
- industrial engineering
- robotics
- machine learning
- deep learning
- blockchain technology
- crypto markets

with geopolitical and societal flavors if apply.

You may ask yourself: 

> Why not in Spanish if you are Spanish?

I am sorry about that, and I wish I had the time to do that. But if I did, I would marginalize many colleagues from other countries.

For example, Germans speak _German_ but also _English_ as a second language, Dutch speak _Dutch_ but also _English_ as a second language, Czechs speak _Czech_ but also _English_ as a second language and so on... you get the point, right?  
We can say, _English_ is the glue for international cooperation and communication.

>Did you know that more than 60% of the content on the Internet is in _English_ as of 2021? [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet)

> Why on a personal website? Why just not on Medium or LinkedIn?  

Because...
1. this is the most flexible way to deploy my creativity
2. apparently I like to complicate myself more than needed

> Have you done it via _Wordpress, Wix, Mobirise_ or similar _SaaS_[^1]?  

Definitely not, these are the easy way. Not a challenge at all, and you have to **pay** for them.

By the way, in order to build this website, I had to spend a lot of time on researching **Static Website Generators**. There are many of them that are available for free such as _Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll_, ...

Remember that open source software is one of the greatest gifts provided by other people for you. It is a total waste of potential that currently, very few % of the world population leverage in this kind of resources.

From my point of view, I decided to give a try to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). If you are interested in doing it in your own, you would just need:
- read the official documentation
- an IDE like _VS Code_
- understaning how to edit _YAML_ or _TOML_ files
- understanding about _Markdown_ formatting
- minimal knowledge in _Go_ language for [short codes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/)

You can choose to use a pre-built [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/), customize a pre-built theme for your interests, or build one from scratch. For the last two, you will need also:
- knowledge in _Go, HTML, CSS, JavaScript_

>I will try to keep the promise of providing you **added value** in every post, like something new you learn or a new thing that inspires you to try new stuff.


This will be an exciting journey, and hopefully you can enjoy from it as well.

See you on the next post.
